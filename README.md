Loops
1.ForLoop
   A for loop iterates over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or range) and executes the code block for each element in the sequence.
2. While Loop
  How it works: A while loop executes the code block as long as the specified condition evaluates to True.
3.Do-While Loop
  A do-while loop is similar to a while loop, but it guarantees that the code block will be executed at least once because the condition is checked at the end of the loop.
4. Nested Loops
   A loop inside another loop. The inner loop completes all its iterations for each iteration of the outer loop.
